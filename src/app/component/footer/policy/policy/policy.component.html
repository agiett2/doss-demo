            <b>DOSS PRIVACY POLICY</b>
             <br>

            At DOSS Group(“DOSS” or “we” or “us” or “our”), we appreciate your use of and
            contributions to our website, our mobile and desktop applications, our other
            properties and/or our related services(collectively known as the “Services, “ or,
            each individually, a “Service”). DOSS Group respects your privacy and is
            committed to protecting your personal information.
            This is our privacy policy and we will comply with it, as well as applicable U.S.
            privacy law, when we gather and use information from users of the Services. We
            encourage you to read this privacy policy to understand what we do with the
            information we collect from you. <br><br>


            <b> COLLECTION of INFORMATION </b> <br>

            When you use the Services, we collect a variety of information. <br>
            • Information you provide: When using the Services, you may provide
            information about yourself, such as name, address, phone number, email
            and details around a potential transaction. This may occur, for example,
            when you register on the Services, claim a home, correspond with a real
            estate agent via the Services, or complete other forms, such as a loan
            request. You may also provide information about a third party through the
            Services, for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via
            email. We may combine this information with other information we collect
            from your interaction with the Services or from other companies. <br> <br>

            In addition, when you order products or services through the Services,
            DOSS Group may collect your credit/debit card information. This
            information is secured using industry-standard encryption technology.
            DOSS Group will use this information solely to compete your order and will
            not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent
            necessary to complete the order or comply with applicable law. <br> <br>


            <b> Cookies and Web beacons </b> <br>

            • Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to your
            computer or other electronic device to uniquely identify your browser.
            When you use the Services, we may place one or more cookies on your
            computer or other electronic device. We may use cookies to connect your
            activity on the Services with other information we store about you in your
            account profile or your prior interactions on the Services to, for example,
            store your preferences. The use of cookies helps us improve the quality of
            the Services to you, by identifying information which is most interesting to
            you, tracking trends, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, or storing
            information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis, such as your
            favorite homes. At any time, you may adjust settings on your browser to
            refuse cookies according to the instructions related to your browser.
            However, if you choose to disable cookies, many of the free features and
            Services will not operate properly. Also, the pages on the Services may
            include Web beacons or pixels, which are electronic files to count users
            who have visited that page, to track activity over time and across different
            Web sites, to identify certain cookies on the computer or other electronic
            device accessing that page, or to collect other related information, and this
            information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier,
            or Internet Protocol address. We may, for example, implement a pixel on
            the pages of the Services where you view a certain advertisement so that
            we can track whether you visit a Web site associated with that
            advertisement at a later time. <br><br>


            <b> Third-party Cookies and Web beacons </b> <br>
            • We work with service providers and advertising networks to track and
            manage cookie information and your activities while you're using the
            Services and your online activities over time and across different websites
            and devices. For example, third-parties may use cookies to deliver
            advertisements to you based on your visit to the Services. For additional
            information, please refer to the section below entitled, "Behavioral
            Advertising." You may opt-out of cookie tracking and analysis from any of
            these service providers and advertising networks by Opting Out of
            Collection of Information, which is explained further below. <br>

            • We have implemented Google Analytics remarketing, which tracks and
            manages cookie information so that we and third-party service providers
            can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on
            the Services and various websites across the Internet. We have also
            implemented Google Analytics display network impression reporting to
            better understand how ad impressions and ad services are related to visits
            to our sites. You can customize ads or opt out of these services using the
            Google Ads Settings. <br><br>


            <b> Mobile Device and Mobile Browser </b> <br>
            • You may adjust settings on your mobile device and mobile browser
            regarding cookies and sharing of certain information, such as your mobile
            device model or the language your mobile device uses, by adjusting the
            privacy and security settings on your mobile device. Please refer to the
            instructions provided by your mobile service provider or mobile device
            manufacturer. <br><br>


            <b> Usage logs </b> <br>
            • When you use the Services, your computer or other electronic device
            communicates a variety of information to computer servers, including the
            existence of cookies, your Internet Protocol address, and information about
            your browser program. We also create a record of what information you
            are requesting, such as the page or subject areas you're visiting.
            Social Networks. <br>

            • If you use the social networking connection functions offered through the
            Services, we may access all of your social network profile information that
            you have made available to be shared and to use it in accordance with this
            privacy policy. Please refer to the instructions governing your social
            network account to manage the information that is shared through your

            • Calls to DOSS Group or to third parties through DOSS Group may be
            recorded or monitored for quality assurance and customer service
            purposes. If a call is recorded between you and a third party, it will be
            deemed private information of both you and the third party, and may be
            released to either of you. <br><br>


            <b> Usage and Disclosure </b> <br>
            • In general, DOSS Group uses the information collected from you to
            communicate with you and operate our Services. DOSS Group also uses this
            information to respond to your requests and present you with advertising
            that we believe will be of interest or useful to you. <br>

            • Your privacy is important and we are committed to protecting information
            that identifies you personally, where you have chosen to keep it private
            ("Personal Information").
            <br><br>

            <b> Consent </b> <br>
            • When you consent or direct DOSS Group to share the Personal Information.
            For example, if you choose to contact a real estate agent or lender through
            the Services, your name and email address will appear to the recipient of
            the message. <br><br>
            

            <b> Service providers to DOSS Group </b> <br>
            • When DOSS Group hires a service provider to help operate the Services or
            our business, DOSS Group may give access to Personal Information only as
            necessary to perform the service for DOSS Group, and subject to the terms
            of this privacy policy. <br><br>


            <b> Partners with whom we conduct business </b> <br>
            • DOSS Group may give business partners access to Personal Information
            only as necessary to offer products and services with those business
            partners, and subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Example: VIVINT,
            etc... <br><br>


            <b> Legal obligation or protection from harm </b> <br>
            • When DOSS Group has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
            disclosure of the Personal Information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy
            any requirement of law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable
            governmental request, (b) enforce or investigate a potential violation of the
            Terms of Use, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise respond to fraud, security or
            technical concerns, (d) support auditing and compliance functions, or (e)
            protect the rights, property, or safety of DOSS Group, its users, or the
            public against harm. <br><br>


            <b> Merger or sale </b> <br>
            • If and when DOSS Group is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of
            transfer or sale of some or all of its business, whether as a going concern or
            as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding. Personal
            Information may be transferred along with the business. <br>

            • When you provide public information without identifying yourself, we will
            protect your personal identity as described above. If your account profile
            does not identify you personally, DOSS Group won't reveal your identity to
            third parties except in accordance with this policy. You should keep in mind
            that the information that you choose to provide in a public area of the
            Services (such as your profile page or the discussion forums) will not be
            protected by this privacy policy because you have made an active choice to
            make that information public. We are not responsible for any Personal
            Information you choose to submit in any public area of the Services. <br>

            • When we deliver ads based on data about your use of the Services, we
            keep your identity anonymous. We won't identify you personally to third
            parties, except in accordance with this privacy policy. Of course, if you
            choose to respond to an advertised offer with your name and contact
            information, you will no longer be anonymous to the advertiser. Further,
            while we do not share your Personal Information with third parties unless
            permitted above, DOSS Group may share aggregate anonymous
            information with third-parties. This information does not personally
            identify individuals, but instead provides a helpful understanding of the
            groups of people who prefer certain types of information and services. <br><br>


            <b> Real Estate Information </b> <br>
            • DOSS Group strives to provide open and transparent information about real
            estate markets. For example, we make available past sales prices for
            homes, and allow any user to post a question or answer about a given
            home. Many times, this information is already publicly available. As long as
            discussion surrounds real estate and not individuals, we intend to keep this
            information freely available through the Services. Where a professional
            participates in the DOSS Group communities, we may also allow users to
            comment on the professional, such as the lender ratings in DOSS
            Mortgages. <br><br>


            <b> Email Management </b> <br>
            • You may receive email from DOSS Group for a variety of reasons - for
            example, if you took an action through the Services, you signed up for a
            regular report, or you posted your home for sale and a buyer sent you a
            message. We respect your desire to manage email correspondence. If you
            have an account with DOSS Group, you can select your preferences through
            your account settings. Also, you can manage your receipt of some types of
            communication by following the instructions included in the email we send
            you. Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from certain email
            correspondences, we may still need to email you with important
            transactional or administrative information. <br><br>


            <b> Behavioral Advertising </b> <br>
            • We may participate in behavioral advertising. This means that, for example,
            when you use the Services, we or third party service providers or
            advertisers may use cookies (that they collect or that we provide to them)
            or other similar technologies to collect information about your use of the
            Services (including mobile applications) or your online activities over time
            and across different Web sites and devices. Collected information may
            include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content,
            and the Web site that referred you to the Services, and this information
            may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier, or Internet
            Protocol address. These practices help tailor advertisements that are
            relevant and useful to you. These tailored advertisements may appear on
            the Services or on other websites, applications or properties. <br>

            • In addition, if you have provided your email address to us, we may use a
            scrambled, unreadable form (a hash) of your email address to deliver
            tailored advertisements to you on the Services or on other websites,
            including via Facebook’s Custom Audience Feature or other similar
            Facebook tools. We will not share your email address with Facebook. Click

            You may opt-out of cookie tracking and analysis as described in the section
            below entitled ‘Opting Out of Collection of Information’. The Services do
            not otherwise respond to ‘do not track’ signals. <br><br>


            <b> Opting Out of Collection of Information by Third Parties </b> <br>
            • DOSS Group's third-party ad servers, ad network providers, and third-party
            advertisers (the "DOSS Group Ad Providers") may provide you with
            advertisements that you may see on the Services or on other affiliated
            websites. To improve the relevancy and help measure the effectiveness of
            such advertisements, the DOSS Group Ad Providers may use cookies, Web
            beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies. These are used to record users'
            activity, such as the pages visited, and to learn what types of information
            are of most interest to the users. <br><br>


            <b> DOSS Group Ad Providers </b> <br>
            • Use of these technologies by DOSS Group Ad Providers is subject to their
            own privacy policies and is not covered by our privacy policy. For more

            out of Cookies/Web beacons from: comScore, Google Analytics, Omniture
            and Yahoo! Opting out of these services does not mean you will no longer
            receive online advertising. It does mean that the service from which you
            opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and
            usage patterns. Please note that, if you opt out and later delete your
            cookies, use a different browser, or use a different computer or other

            <b> Location Data </b> <br>
            • DOSS Group can provide you with helpful information based on where you
            are. If you tell DOSS Group where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile
            device to send DOSS Group your location), DOSS Group may use that
            information to provide you with location-based information and
            advertising. If you wish to deactivate this feature, you can disable location
            services on your mobile device. <br><br>

            These third-party websites may collect Personal Information about users on

            external websites and third parties. Please refer directly to these third
            parties and websites regarding their privacy policies. <br><br>
